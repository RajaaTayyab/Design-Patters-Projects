# 🍽️ J&J's Restaurant Management System

A **console-based restaurant management system** developed in **C++**, designed to simulate core operations of a real-world restaurant, including order placement, serving, billing, and customer management. The system handles both **Dine-In** and **Take-Away** customers and maintains records using efficient data structures.

## 🧠 Design Patterns Implemented

This project demonstrates the use of essential object-oriented design patterns:

- **🔁 Strategy Pattern**  
  Enables dynamic billing strategies (e.g., discounts for senior citizens, dine-in surcharges, etc.).

- **🔔 Observer Pattern**  
  Used to update system statistics or reports automatically when the order list changes.

- **🔒 Singleton Pattern**  
  Ensures only one instance of the Restaurant class exists across the system.
